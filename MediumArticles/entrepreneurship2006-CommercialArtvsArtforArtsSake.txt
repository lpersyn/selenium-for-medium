In retrospect to my last post on waiting for ones muse, heres another question thats undoubtedly had its share of time in many an artists mind: the art-for-money vis-a-vis art-for-art issue. Lyndon Gregorio has some thoughts:
Should an artist pursue sellable art or should he create art for arts sake? The first doesnt really push the envelope while the latter doesnt really pay the bills.
Lyndon considers himself both an artist and an entrepreneur (IMHO, entrepreneurship is, to some extent, intrinsic in being an artist). His business card says Creator, as his title. And guess how he responds to the question? Do em both!
The lesson is an artist worth his/her salt can create both commercial and artistically compelling art, even separately. You can try to make both in a single product, but the driving forces between the commercial and artistic are mutually exclusive.
Ever wonder why the J Spot has no ads? You may be wondering how I monetize this blog if theres no hint of any advertisement around, contextual or otherwise (I have AdSense on most of my other sites, though, even the old J Spot). Ill write about this later. But suffice to say for now that Id rather not be pressured to earn from this site  at least for now. And lets just say that Id rather build up my sites intrinsic value first before venturing into monetization, if at all!
Yes, I consider blogging as an art form, or at least a form of creative expression (hey, we write, dont we?).
