Wow! I didnt realize this until I tried looking for our new apartment via satellite imagery. Previously, only the client-version of Googles geo service, Google Earth:http://earth.google.com , had higher res aerial imagery of Metro Manila. now, even the online version, Google Maps:http://maps.google.com does! I say higher because this is definitely better than what Maps had to offer before. Still, its not as good as Google Earth, and its definitely not up to par with the aerial photos or Ikonos:http://spaceimaging.com / Quickbird:http://digitalglobe.com satellite images that the surveying companies will give you for a few million Pesos.
Here are some screencaps of imagery of my beloved Quezon City.
Both our old and new apartments are in this area.:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=quezon+city+philippines&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=14.647047,121.057706&spn=0.002263,0.004576&t=k&om=1
Heres the University of the Philippines Admin building, where the Oblation is located.:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=quezon+city+philippines&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=14.654821,121.064937&spn=0.002263,0.004576&t=k&om=1
Heres the Gateway Mall and the Araneta Colliseum in Cubao.:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=quezon+city+philippines&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=14.621224,121.053023&spn=0.002263,0.004576&t=k&om=1
Heres SM North EDSA, sans the new Block mall.:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=quezon+city+philippines&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=14.656518,121.031892&spn=0.002263,0.004576&t=k&om=1 This means the aerial photos were probably taken pre-2006, when SM was still using the area as a parking lot.
This could open up a lot of new business opportunities for people who do web apps! This was exactly what I was looking for back when I worked with i.PH  location-based services and geotagging were the hot thing back then. I wonder if its still a good idea to do this today. Joel was right. Googles going to put those aerial photo and satellite imagery companies out of business (at least for the consumer/low-end market, and not those requiring millimiter-level accuracy). Google is giving this stuff away for free!
Web apps, anyone? I hope we beat you guys to it! :P
