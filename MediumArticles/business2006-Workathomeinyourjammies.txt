SmugMugs mantra for our help desk was shamelessly stolen from Mark Twain, who wrote: Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.
We do our best to astonish our customers by answering help email in minutes.
We do it by hiring people who know and love SmugMug and its customers. They work full or part-time, from our help center in Salt Lake City, Utah, or from their homes in their jammies.
Ivar, for example, works from Utrecht in the Netherlands. His specialty is helping customize. Barb Gates from Boise, Idaho, has the digital photography fever and came to us by way of our community.
Ivar and Barb are customers who have the passion. They both work (play?) part-time, from their homes, to the delight of many SmugMug customers who receive quick, friendly and knowledgeable advice from them.
Our customers come from every walk of life. What binds them is their passion for lifes memories.
If helping them while sprawled on the couch with a laptop sounds like a dream job, why not drop help at smugmug dot com a line to get more info?
