You want a blog to go with your website. Seems simple, right?
Maybe, but you wouldnt believe how often our Support Heroes often get questions about how to do this on SmugMug. If this sounds like you (or were just thinking about it), then youre in luck.
First of all, why WordPress? Its great for frequent updates and extra SEO, and its a great complement to your SmugMug portfolio, proofing and print sales. Here are three different ways you can have both a Smug site and a fabulous WordPress blog the best of both worlds!

Our friends over at FastLine Media are pros at creating custom SmugMug sites with beautiful blogs. Owners, brothers and pro photographers Justin and Brandon recommend setting up your SmugMug site like a portfolio, displaying only your best photos to keep your audience captivated. Your Smug site will contain text pages (About Me, Contact, Pricing, etc), a few public portfolio galleries and your unlisted client galleries.
It should also contain a link to your blog. A simple WordPress blog linked from your site is the perfect place to post photos and write some thoughts about a recent event youve shot. You get to share more photos publicly than just the one or two images you add to your portfolio, but dont have to go as far as sharing every photo from your clients private galleries. Your blog becomes an extension of your portfolio, and you get to decide how much.

The benefit? Like SmugMug, WordPress has great SEO benefits. If you shoot a wedding at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, you could make the title of your post, Jack and Jills Wedding at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay. Due to the magic of WordPress, those keywords in your blog title automagically appear in the browser title and meta description. Booya!
