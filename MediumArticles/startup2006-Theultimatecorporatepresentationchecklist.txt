Clients working on creating a sales presentation or other corporate presentation often ask what topics they should cover. When developing a compelling business presentation, we advise clients it is helpful to work against a checklist to ensure that nothing important is missed. We built the following list as a guide. The list is not exhaustive and not all topics will be appropriate in all cases. The list is generally in a meaningful sequence, but should be customized.
