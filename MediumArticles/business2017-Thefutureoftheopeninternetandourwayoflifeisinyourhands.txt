There are a lot of scary things happening these days, but heres what keeps me up late at night. A handful of corporations are turning our open internet into this:
These corporations want to lock down the internet and give us access to nothing more than a few walled gardens. They want to burn down the Library of Alexandria and replace it with a magazine rack.
Why? Because theyll make more money that way.
This may sound like a conspiracy theory, but this process is moving forward at an alarming rate.
So far, the story of the internet has followed the same tragic narrative thats befallen other information technologies over the past 160 years:
Each of these had roughly the same story arc:
This loop has repeated itself so many times that Tim Wu  the Harvard law professor who coined the term Net Neutrality  has a name for it: The Cycle.
History shows a typical progression of information technologies, from somebodys hobby to somebodys industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel  from open to closed system.  Tim Wu
And right now, were in step 4 the open internets narrative. Were surrounded by monopolies.
The problem is that weve been in step 4 for decades now. And theres no step 5 in sight. The creative destruction that the Economist Joseph Schumpeter first observed in the early 1900s has yet to materialize.
The internet, it seems, is special. Its the ultimate information technology  capable of supplanting the telegram, telephone, radio, cinema, television, and much more  and theres no clear way to disrupt it.
But the war for the commanding heights of the internet is far from over. There are many players on this global chess board. Governments. Telecom monopolies. Internet giants like Google and Facebook. NGOs. Startups. Hackers. And  most importantly  you.
The war for the open internet is the defining issue of our time. Its a scramble for control of the very fabric of human communication. And human communication is all that separates us from the utopia that thousands of generations of our ancestors slowly marched us toward  or the Orwellian, Huxleyan, Kafkaesque dystopia that a locked-down internet would make possible.
By the end of this article, youll understand whats happening, the market forces that are driving this, and how you can help stop it. Well talk about the brazen monopolies who maneuver to lock down the internet, the scrappy idealists who fight to keep it open, and the vast majority of people who are completely oblivious to this battle for the future.
In Part 1, well explore what the open internet is and delve into the history of the technological revolutions that preceded it.
In Part 2, well talk about the atoms. The physical infrastructure of the internet. The internet backbone. Communication satellites. The last mile of copper and fiber optic cables that provide broadband internet.
In Part 3, well talk about bits. The open, distributed nature of the internet and how its being cordoned off into walled gardens by some of the largest multinational corporations in the world.
In Part 4, well explore the implications of all this for consumers and for startups. Youll see how you can help save the open internet. Ill share some practical steps you can take as a citizen of the internet to do your part and keep it open.
This is a long read. So grab a hot beverage and get ready to download a massive corpus of technology history into your brain.
Theres only one word to describe the open internet: chaos.
The open internet is a cacophony of 3 billion voices screaming over one another. Its a dusty, sprawling bazaar. And its messy. But it has produced some of the greatest art and industry of our time.
The open internet is a Miltonian marketplace of ideas, guided by a Smithian invisible hand of free-market capitalism.
The open internet is distributed. Its owned in part by everyone and in whole by no one. It exists largely outside of the boundaries of governments. And its this way by design.
This reflects the wisdom of Vint Cerf, Bob Khan, J. C. R. Licklider, and all the wizards who stayed up late and pioneered the internet. They had seen the anti-capitalist, corporatists fate that befell the telegram, the telephone, the radio, and the TV. They wanted no part of that for their invention.
The open internet is a New Mexico Quilters Association. Its a Jeremy Renner fan club. Its a North Carolina poetry slam. Its a Washington D.C. hackerspace. Its a municipal website for Truckee, California. Its a Babylon 5 fan fiction website.
The open internet is a general purpose tool where anyone can publish content, and anyone can then consume that content. It is a Cambrian Explosion of ideas and of execution.
Can these websites survive in a top-down, command-and-control closed internet? Will they pay for shelf space on a cable TV-like list of packages? Will they pay for a slice of attention in crowded walled gardens?
Heres a brief history of the information technologies that came before the internet, and how quickly corporations and governments consolidated them.
Originally anyone could string up some cable, then start tapping out Morse Code messages to their friends. The telegram was a fun tool that had some practical applications, too. Local businesses emerged around it.
That changed in 1851 when Western Union strung up transcontinental lines and built relay stations between them.
If small telegraph companies wanted to be able to compete, they needed access to Western Unions network. Soon, they were squeezed out entirely.
At one point Western Union was so powerful that it was able to single-handedly install a US President. If you grew up in America, you may have memorized this presidents name as a child: Rutherford B. Hayes.
Not only did Western Union back Hayes campaign financially, it also used its unique position as the information backbone for espionage purposes. It was able to read telegrams from Hayes political opponents and make sure Hayes was always one step ahead.
Western Unions dominance  and monopoly pricing  would last for decades until Alexander Graham Bell disrupted its business with his newly-invented telephone.
After a period of party lines and local telephone companies, AT&T  backed by JP Morgan  built a network of long-distance lines throughout America.
In order for the customers of local phone companies to be able to call people in other cities, those companies had to pay AT&T for the privilege of using its long-distance network.
Theodore Vail  a benevolent monopolist if there ever was one  thought that full control of Americas phone systems was the best way to avoid messy, wasteful capitalistic competition. He argued that his way was better for consumers. And to be fair, it was. At least in the short run.
Vail was able to use AT&Ts monopoly profits to subsidize the development of rural phone lines. This helped him rapidly connect all of America and unify it under a single standardized system.
But the problem with benevolent monopolists is they dont live forever. Sooner or later, they are replaced by second-generation CEOs, who often lack any of their predecessors idealism. They are only after one thing  the capitalists prerogative  maximizing shareholder value. That means making a profit, dispersing dividends, and beating quarterly earnings projections. Which means extracting as much money from customers as possible.
AT&T eventually squeezed out their competitors completely. And once AT&Ts monopoly became apparent, the US Government took action to regulate it. But AT&T was much smarter than its regulators, and jumped on an opportunity to become a state-sponsored natural monopoly.
AT&T would enjoy monopoly profits for decades before being broken up by the FCC in 1982.
But the baby bells wouldnt stay divided for long. In 1997, they were able to start merging back together into a corporation even bigger than before the break-up.
The end result is one of the most powerful corporations on the planet  strong enough to expand its monopoly from the land-line telephone industry to the emerging wireless telecom industry.
AT&T functioned like a branch of government and had extensive research labs, but with one major exception  it could keep secret any inventions that it perceived as a threat to its core business.
Voicemail  and digital tape, which was later used as a critical data storage medium for computers  was actually invented within one of AT&Ts labs in 1934. But they buried it. It was only re-invented decades later.
Imagine how much progress the field of information technology could have made during that length of time with such a reliable and high-volume data storage medium at its disposal.
To give you some idea of how much just this one AT&T decision may have cost humanity, imagine that a corporation purposefully delayed the introduction of email by a decade. What would be the total impact on the productivity of society? How many trillions of dollars in lost economic activity would such an action cost us? This is the cautionary tale of what happens when you leave scientific research and development to private industry instead of public labs and universities.
You can still feel the legacy of AT&Ts monopoly when you call an older person from out of state. They will instinctively try to keep the call as short as possible, because they want to avoid the massive long distance fees historically associated with such calls, even though these no longer apply.
I thought this was just my grandmother, but its everyones grandmother. Entire generations have been traumatized by AT&Ts monopolistic pricing.
Shortly after the invention of cinema, we had thousands of movie theaters around the US showing a wide variety of independently-produced films on all manner of topics. Anyone could produce a film, then screen it at their local theater.
That changed when Adolf Zukor founded Paramount Pictures. He pioneered the practice of block booking. If small independent theaters wanted to screen, say, the newest Mae West film, they would also need to purchase and screen a bunch of other lessor films.
This took away theater owners status as local tastemakers, and removed their ability to cater to their own local demographics. The result was the commoditization of movie theaters, and ultimately the rise of blockbuster cinema.
Shortly after Marconi  or Tesla  invented the radio, a massive hobbyist movement sprung up around it. There were thousands of local radio stations playing amateur programs.
In stepped David Sarnoff as the head of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). He was perhaps the most Machiavellian CEO of the 20th century.
At the time, RCA was making parts for radio. Conventional thinking at the time was that RCA should focus on hardware, and getting as many radio stations running and as many radios into homes as possible. But Sarnoff realized that the real money was in content. He helped popularize the National Broadcast Corporation (NBC) and focused instead on making money through advertisements.
Then Sarnoff approached the Federal Radio Commission  now the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and convinced them that since the radio spectrum was a scarce commodity, they should carve it up and issue licenses.
Soon, NBC was available in every home, and the local hobbyist radio stations were squeezed off the air. RCA was now vertically integrated  from the parts in the radio stations, to the parts in consumer radios, to the content being broadcast itself.
Sarnoff had talked with the inventors of TV, and knew that it would eventually disrupt radio. But he had a plan. To claim the invention of television for himself.
TV is different from other forms of technology here, in that it didnt enjoy a hobbyist stage. With the help of the FCC, Sarnoff and RCA immediately locked TV down. The result was several decades where Americans had just three channels to choose from  NBC, CBS, and ABC.
This was the height of mass culture  half of all Americans watching the same episode of I Love Lucy at the same time. The popularity of television  combined with the lack of diversity in programming caused by this monopoly  had social and political consequences that haunt us to this day.
Weve gone through the invention step. The infrastructure came out of DARPA and the World Wide Web itself came out of CERN.
Weve gone through the hobbyist step. Everyone now knows what the internet is, and some of the amazing things its capable of.
Weve gone through the commercialization step. Monopolies have emerged, refined, and scaled the internet.
But the question remains: can we break with the tragic history that has befallen all prior information empires? Can this time be different?
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Arthur C. Clarkes Third Law
As much as we may think of the internet as a placeless realm of pure abstractions, it has a physical structure. Its not magic. And more people are waking up to this reality each day.
The internet is a series of copper and fiber optic cables that burrow through the ground and tunnel under oceans. We call this the Internet Backbone. Heres what it looks like:
The internet is then further distributed through regional backbones. Heres all the fiber that carries internet data around the United States. Red squares represent the junctions between long haul fibers.
Six major companies control the backbone, and they hand off traffic from one another without any money exchanging hands:
Within the US, the backbone is mostly controlled by old long distance carriers, including Verizon and AT&T  who also control a two thirds of Americas $200 billion wireless industry.
These companies peer traffic through backbone connections controlled by other companies, or pay each other through transit agreements.
Despite the involvement of these huge telecoms, the internet backbone represents a fairly healthy market. About 40% of the internets backbone is controlled by smaller networks youve never heard of.
The broadband internet market, on the other hand, isnt healthy at all. This is the last mile of cables that plug into the internet backbone. And its full of ugly tollbooths, guarded by thick benches of lawyers and lobbyists.
This broadband internet market is controlled by just three extremely powerful  and widely hated  internet service providers (ISPs):
Another form of ISPs are the wireless providers:
These two providers control 2/3rd of the wireless market. If you have a mobile phone, theres a good chance you pay one of these companies every month for your data plan.
These ISPs control millions of miles of copper cables that they buried in the ground back in the 1970s, and satellites they shot up into orbit in the 1990s. They constantly break the law, tie up regulators in lengthy court battles, and make it practically impossible for anyone  even Google  to enter their markets.
The ISPs do all this for one reason and one reason alone: so they can avoid free market competition  and the expensive technology upgrades it would require  while they continue raking in their monopoly rents from the 2/3 of Americans who only have one choice in their neighborhood for broadband internet.
For the past two years, the public had a weapon against these ISPs. Its not one that can mortally wound them , but it has helped beat back their monopolistic tendencies. Its called Net Neutrality.
The story of ISPs basically comes down to this: They used to make a ton of money off of cable packages. But people discovered that once they had the internet, they didnt care about cable TV any more  they just wanted data plans and so they could watch YouTube, Netflix, or whatever shows they wanted  and they could also consume a lot of non-video content, too.
The ISPs dont make nearly as much selling you a data plan as they used to make selling you a cable plan, though. So their goal is to return to the good old days by locking down the internet into channels and bundles then forcing you to buy those.
How do we prevent this? The good news is that we already have. In 2015, the FCC passed a law that regulated ISPs as utilities. This is based on the principle of Net Neutrality which basically states that all information passing through a network should be treated equally.
As part of its 2015 decision on Net Neutrality, the FCC asked for public comment on this topic. 3 million Americans wrote to the FCC. Less than 1% of those people were opposed to Net Neutrality.
After a hard fought battle against telecoms, we convinced the FCC to enshrine Net Neutrality into law.
The FCCs Title II regulation created three bright lines that prevent ISPs from doing the following:
These rules made it so that no matter how rich and powerful a corporation is  and Apple and Google are the biggest corporations on Earth, and Microsoft and Facebook arent far behind  they cant buy priority access to the internet.
Everyone has to compete on a level playing field. These tech conglomerates have to compete with the scrappy startups, the mom-and-pop businesses, and even independent bloggers who are running WordPress on their own domain.
Nobody is above Net Neutrality. Its as simple a tool as possible for protecting the capitalist free market internet from monopolies who would otherwise abuse their power.
Now ISPs are treated like a utility. How are the packets being routed through a network different from the water being piped through the ground, or the electricity flowing through a power grid?
The water company shouldnt care whether youre turning on a tap to wash dishes or to take a shower.
The power company shouldnt care whether youre plugging in a TV or a toaster.
The ISPs shouldnt care what data you want or what you use it for.
The reason ISPs want to get rid of Net Neutrality is simple: if we stop treating them like the utility that they are, they can find ways to charge a lot more money.
Heres the former CEO of AT&T laying out his evil plan:
Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free, but I aint going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it. So theres going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion theyre using. Why should they be allowed to use my pipes? The Internet cant be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo! or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes [for] free is nuts!  Edward Whitacre, AT&T CEO
What he should certainly realize is that everyone is already paying for internet access. Youre paying to be able to access this article. Im paying to push this article up onto the internet. This website is paying to send the traffic from its servers over to your computer.
We have all already paid to use these ISPs last mile of cables. No one is using these pipes for free.
But the ISPs see an opportunity to double dip. They want to charge for bandwidth, and also charge websites what the Mafia calls protection money. They essentially want to be able to say to website owners: Those are some lovely data packets youve got there. It sure would be a shame if they got lost on their way to your users.
Of course, most of the open internet couldnt afford to pay this protection money to ISPs, so the ISPs would block traffic to their websites, cutting consumers off from most of the open internet. But the ISPs wouldnt need to block these websites. All the ISPs would need to do is introduce a slight latency.
Both Google and Microsoft have done research that shows that if you slow down a website by even 250 milliseconds  about how long it takes to blink your eyes  most people will abandon that website.
Thats right  speed isnt a feature, its a basic prerequisite for attracting an audience. We humans are extremely impatient and becoming more so with each passing year.
This means that in practice, if an ISP artificially slows down a website, its practically as damaging as blocking the site entirely. Both of these acts result in the same outcome  a severe loss of traffic.
Traffic is the lifeblood of websites. Without traffic, merchandise doesnt get sold. Services dont get subscribed to. Donations dont get made.
Without traffic, the open web dies  whether ISPs block it or not.
With Januarys change in US administration and the election of our 45th president, the FCC has changed as well.
The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  a former Verizon lawyer  is now in control of the only regulator that the ISPs answer to. And heres a direct quote from him:
We need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai
The ISPs wont reinvest their protection money in infrastructure. They already have incredible monopoly profits. Heres their net income (after-tax profits) from 2016:
They have plenty of profit they could claw back into improving infrastructure. Theyre choosing instead to disperse this money to shareholders.
In just two months, Chairman Pai has already done incredible damage to Net Neutrality. He dropped Zero Rating lawsuits against four monopolies who were in clear violation of Net Neutrality law. Now Comcast and AT&T can continue to stream their own video services without them counting toward customers data caps, and theres nothing the FCC will do about it.
Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler did his best to reach out to Chairman Pai and convince him of the virtues of Net Neutrality. The two were scheduled to meet once every two weeks during Wheelers last 18 months in office. But Pai cancelled every single one of these meetings.
You have to have open networks  permissionless innovation. Period. End of discussion. Theyre crucial to the future.  Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler
What does a post Net Neutrality internet look like? Look no further than the Apple App store.
There are two million apps in the app store, which shared a total of $28 billion in 2016. Apple takes a 30% commission on every sale, and made $8.4 billion from the app store alone.
Most of the remaining $20 billion goes to just a small handful of mobile gaming companies:
Most iPhone users download zero apps per month.
The minority who do bother to download new apps dont end up downloading very many.
And all 8 of the top apps in the app store are owned by just two corporations: Facebook and Google.
A vast majority of the remaining 2 million apps get very little traffic  and even less money.
The Apple App Store isnt a level playing field. It doesnt resemble the open internet it was built on top of. Instead, its an example of a walled garden.
Walled gardens look beautiful. Theyre home to the most popular flora. But make no mistake, you wont be able to venture very far in any one direction without encountering a wall.
And every walled garden has a gatekeeper, who uproots plants that look like weeds. If you want to plant something in a walled garden, you have to get approval from that gatekeeper. And Apple is one of the most aggressive gatekeepers of all. It keeps out apps that compete with its own interests, and censors apps that dont mesh with its corporate worldview.
First there was the original walled garden of the internet, AOL.
20 years later, AOL still has 2 million users paying them $20/month. Theres a lot of money to be made in building walled gardens and trapping users in them.
Then came Yahoo, which wasnt a walled garden by design, but became one anyway because people were so new to the internet.
In the late 90s, startups raised money specifically so they could buy banner ads on Yahoo. It was the best way they could reach prospective users.
But Yahoo was a candle in the sun compared to the ultimate walled garden: Facebook.
A quarter of the people on Earth use Facebook for an average of 50 minutes each day.
And those 50 million people connected to Internet.org that Mark Zuckerberg is bragging about? Those are people from extremely poor countries who were given a choice: they could either pay for the open internet or just get Facebook for free. They chose Facebook.
The insidiously-named Internet.org was famously rejected in India  among other countries  where activists were able to raise awareness about all the things Indians would give up by accepting Facebook instead of the open internet.
Mark Zuckerberg may mean well, but hes rapidly destroying the open internet. In his ravenous quest to expand Facebooks market share, hes even gone so far as to build a sophisticated censorship tool so that Facebook can appease the governments of countries where its currently blocked, like China.
And Facebook is just one of several internet corporations who stand to profit from these sort of closed-source, closed-data walled garden platforms.
Here are the 10 largest corporations in the world by market capitalization:
All of them are American-based multinationals. 5 out of 10 of them are internet companies, and one of them is an ISP.
Once you look past the last gasp of the banks and the oil companies, it becomes clear that these internet companies are the new order. They control information. They control the conversation. They control politics. Facebook won the new president the election  even the president and his advisors acknowledge this.
So what makes you think they wont come to control the very internet they dominate?
Even as the costs of launching a website fall, the costs of reaching an audience continue to rise.
Facebook and Google account for 85% of all new dollars spent on online advertising. Everyone else  newspapers, blogs, video networks  is fighting for crumbs  the 15% that fell from Facebooks and Googles mouths.
Half of all internet traffic now flows to just 30 websites. The remaining half is thinly spread across the 60 trillion unique webpages currently indexed by Google.
If youre familiar with the concept of a long tail distribution, youll recognize this phenomenon as an extremely fat head with an extremely long, skinny tail.
You may think that the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Larry Pages of the world would know better than to abuse their power. But such scandals have happened in the past.
Reddit is one of the most popular websites on the internet. One of its founders recently put the companys reputation in jeopardy. He admitted that he had modified users comments in Reddits database  essentially putting words in the mouths of people who were critical of him.
We are not only placing faith in the temperament of the elite handful of tech company founders. Were also trusting that other actors  who ultimately take over these organizations  will be benevolent. Even when we know that their shareholders  or governments  can force them to be malevolent and do things that go against their users interests.
However you may feel about Mark Zuckerberg and his intentions, know this: Just like the benevolent monopolist Theodore Vail, who championed rural access to AT&T in the early 20th century, Mark Zuckerberg will one day retire. And the person who takes over Facebook will not be nearly as forward thinking as he is. Most likely, it will be some finance guy or sales guy who will sell Facebook users  and their Exabytes of data  down the river.
If we lose net neutrality, websites that once freely operated on the open internet will face three choices:
This last option will be the most appealing for most small businesses. They will choose the free option. And in doing so, theyll hand over to the walled gardens some amount of control over their own websites.
A Google or a Facebook will step in to help ensure that your customers are able to access your businesss website. These walled gardens will pay ISPs on your behalf, and help serve your content on their own domains. But in return, the walled garden could:
Just like with Google ads or Facebook ads, the internet will become a race to see who can pay walled gardens the most money so they can gain access to customers. And most of this will be completely invisible to consumers.
There are precedents for all of this.
Facebook convinced millions of businesses to setup Facebook pages. The companies then spent their own money publicizing their Facebook pages and getting their customers to like their pages. Then Facebook pulled a bait-and-switch, and made it so these businesses would have to advertise through Facebook if they wanted to reach their own customers whod previously liked their pages.
And heres what happens when a small nonprofit like freeCodeCamp refuses to pay for Google ads:
Companies with lots of money like this one  which is a subsidiary of Kaplan, one of the largest for-profit education conglomerates on earth  can pay money to Google so they can intercept our users.
And these ads will gradually look less and less like ads. Heres how Google ads have changed over time to look more and more like normal search results:
Now that tiny, green-bordered box with the word ad in it is all that distinguishes an advertisement from a legitimate search result. It is perhaps unsurprising that 55% of Google users dont even recognize the fact that these are ads.
Eventually walled gardens may converge on something similar to Baidu, Chinas largest search engine, which for a long time wasnt labelling ads at all.
Baidu got into trouble last year after a college student used their search engine to seek treatment for a commonly treatable form of cancer. The student went to a hospital he found at the top of Baidus search results.
What the student didnt know was that that hospital had paid Baidu money to be put at the top of the search results, and that this was in fact an advertisement. But Baidu had deliberately obscured this fact from their users so they could charge more for the ad.
The hospital proceeded to recommend an expensive and unproven drug instead of the standard  and far cheaper  treatment of surgery and chemotherapy.
After exhausting his familys savings of $30,o00 on the ineffective treatment, the 21-year-old student wrote one final essay about his situation and how Baidu had lead him right into the hands of fraudsters. Then he died.
This is just a glimpse into the human toll that these walled gardens can inflict upon society. In a walled garden environment where only those who pay money get seen, consumers will face more misinformation, more fraud, and more needless suffering.
Instead of the equalizing force that was the open internet, the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. The internets promise of economic democratization will fall by the wayside, and well enter yet another age of peasants living under feudal lords.
China has the most sophisticated censorship tools in the world. So much so that other authoritarian regimes license the use of these tools to control their own populations.
1.4 billion Chinese people are trapped in a closed internet, behind the Great Firewall of China.
The anti-Net Neutrality agenda that the ISPs are pursuing would require them to use a technique called Deep Packet Inspection. Without looking inside the contents of every packet, its impossible for an ISP to decide which packets they want to selectively slow down.
This means that in addition to sending packets of data through their networks, ISPs would actually have to look inside each of these packets  and would quite likely record the contents of these packets. It would be expensive, but storing major chunks of the Zettabyte of information the internet generates each year is within the budgets of large corporations and governments.
Theres a precedent for this, too. AT&T illegally monitored all of its traffic for years.
Monitoring internet traffic at this level of detail would make pervasive censorship possible. This is one of the techniques China uses to re-write its history. And it works. Despite the advances in information technology, to this day many Chinese still dont know that the Tiananmen Massacre happened. And when they do learn of it, its ancient history  sapped of most of its perceived relevance.
Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas.  Joseph Stalin
If the ISPs succeed and the open internet falls, corporations and governments would have a mandate to censor the most powerful communication tool in human history  the internet  in its entirety.
Whether these corporations are aggregating power through regulatory capture or by amassing exabytes of your data, they are steadily becoming more powerful. They are using their growing cashflow to buy up competitors.
This isnt capitalism  its corporatism. Capitalism is messy. Its wasteful. But its much healthier in the long run for society than central planning and governments trying to pick the winners.
Capitalism allows for small businesses to enter the arena and actually stand a chance. Corporatism makes that unlikely.
If youve read this far, I hope you understand the gravity of this situation. This is not speculative. This is really happening. There are historical precedents. There are present-day examples.
If you do nothing, we will lose the war for the open internet. The greatest tool for communication and creativity in human history will fall into the hands of a few powerful corporations and governments.
Without your actions, corporations will continue to lock down the internet in ways that benefit them  not the public.
The good news is that our great grandparents reined in similar monopolies. At the beginning of the 20th century, Americans faced abusive oil, railroad, and meat industry monopolies. We prevailed over them by raising awareness through brave journalism, and by compelling the government to act.
Today, our most urgent task at hand is stopping FCC Chairman Ajit Pai from disassembling Net Neutrality.
Help us fight this war. Heres what Im asking you to do:
Only we, the public, can end The Cycle of closed systems. Only we can save the open internet.
Thank you for reading this, and for caring about the fate of our open internet.
I only write about programming and technology. If you follow me on Twitter I wont waste your time.
